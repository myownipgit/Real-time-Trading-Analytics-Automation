# SQL Analytics Guide: Real-time Trading Analytics Automation System

## Overview

This system includes 8 comprehensive SQL analytics files that provide deep insights into your trading performance. Each SQL file contains complete table schemas, data population queries, analysis examples, and maintenance scripts.

## ðŸ“Š Analytics Categories

### 1. Performance Rankings (`sql/performance_rankings.sql`)

**Purpose:** Ranks trading pairs by profitability to identify top performers

**Business Questions Answered:**

## ðŸ”§ Using the SQL Files

### Automated Execution
The trading automation system automatically executes these SQL files when new trades complete. You don't need to run them manually unless you want to refresh the data.

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Run all analytics
for sql_file in sql/*.sql; do
    echo "Processing $sql_file..."
    sqlite3 ~/db_dev/trading_test.db < "$sql_file"
done

# Run specific analytics
sqlite3 ~/db_dev/trading_test.db < sql/performance_rankings.sql
sqlite3 ~/db_dev/trading_test.db < sql/timing_analysis.sql
```

### Custom Analysis
Each SQL file includes:
- **Table creation** scripts with proper indexing
- **Data population** queries for automation
- **Example queries** for analysis
- **Maintenance queries** for data quality

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Interactive analysis
sqlite3 ~/db_dev/trading_test.db

# Export results to CSV
sqlite3 -header -csv ~/db_dev/trading_test.db "SELECT * FROM performance_rankings" > performance_report.csv

# Create custom reports
sqlite3 ~/db_dev/trading_test.db "
.mode column
.headers on
SELECT 
    pr.entity_name as pair,
    pr.profit_pct,
    rm.volatility_pct,
    ta.best_performance_hour
FROM performance_rankings pr
JOIN risk_metrics rm ON pr.entity_name = rm.entity_name
JOIN timing_analysis ta ON ta.time_category = 'overall'
WHERE pr.ranking_type = 'by_pair'
ORDER BY pr.profit_pct DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

## ðŸš¨ Alert System

The Bot Health Metrics provide automated alerts:

- **CRITICAL**: Requires immediate attention (win rate <40% or losing money)
- **WARNING**: Needs monitoring (win rate 40-60% or minimal profits)
- **HEALTHY**: System performing well (win rate >60% and profitable)

Monitor these alerts daily to maintain optimal trading performance.
